      <title><![CDATA[EPI Problem Solution Integration]]></title>
      <url>http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/2015/11/28/2015-04-03-integrated-problems-and-solutions/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="<!-￼0->"></h1><p>A number of readers have suggested integrating solutions with problems, that is presenting<br>the solution immediately after the problem. Their goal is to avoid having to go back<br>and forth.</p>
<p>This has been particularly challenging for readers using the Ebook - Google Play strips<br>the links we provide in the PDF between problems and solutions (and also to page and figure references).</p>
<p>We have updated EPI to have this integration. The new version is now available from Amazon.</p>
<p>If you have an Ebook, you can always get the latest version for free from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Adnan_Aziz_Elements_of_Programming_Interviews?id=y6FLBQAAQBAJ" target="_blank" rel="external">Google Play</a>. </p>
<p>Happy Reading,<br>The EPI Team</p>

      <url>http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/2015/11/28/Warming-Up/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="<!-￼0->"></h1><p>The programming exercises in EPI are representative of what you will be asked<br>in an interview. We do not provide textbook-style review questions.</p>
<p>In this document, we present a small set of programming exercises suitable for<br>someone who needs to review basics. (You are unlikely to be<br>asked these questions - their purpose is to bootstrap reading EPI.) </p>
<p>When you write your solutions to these exercises, please code to the following constraints:</p>
<ol><br><li>Do not use library calls.<br></li><li>Do not try to design clever solutions. (This means it is fine to use brute-force approaches.)<br></li><li>Assume valid inputs, and ignore internal errors like overflow, IO exceptions, etc.<br></li><li>Write unit tests for your programs.<br></li><li>Analyze your programs for time and space complexity.<br></li></ol>


<p></p><h3>Exercises, one for each EPI chapter</h3><p></p>
<ol><br><li> Primitive types: write a program that takes as input an integer, N, and prints<br>all the integers from 1 to N, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with “fizz”, numbers divisible by<br>5 with “buzz”, and numbers divisible by both with “fizz buzz”.<br></li><li> Arrays: Write a program that tests if a 2D square array is symmetric about the diagonal<br>from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1).<br></li><li> Strings: Write a program to find the longest substring that consists of a single<br>character in an input string.<br></li><li> Linked Lists: Implement a doubly linked list of integers class. Write a reverse method for your list class<br>that reverses a list without changing the node contents.<br></li><li> Stacks and Queues: Write a programt to evaluate arithmetical expressions that use + and <em> applied<br>to nonnegative integer arguments. Expressions are in reverse-Polish notation, e.g., 3 4 + 5 </em>, 1 3 + 5 7 + *.<br></li><li> Binary Trees: Write inorder, preorder and postorder traversal methods for a binary tree. (You will need<br>to implement a class suitable for representing binary trees, but do not need to implement<br>add, lookup, delete, etc. methods.)<br></li><li> Heaps: Write a program that builds a max-heap from an integer array. (You will need to implement<br>a class suitable for representing heaps, but do not need to implement extract-max, insert key, etc.)<br></li><li> Searching: Write a nonrecursive program to perform binary search over a sorted array.<br></li><li> Hash tables: Write a program that finds the most common object in an array of objects. The<br>objects consists of pairs of strings. Treat strings as being the same if they are equal when converted to lower case.<br></li><li> BSTs: Write a program that searches a BST on integer keys for a given value. (You will need to<br>implement a class suitable for representing BSTs, but do not need to implement<br>add, lookup, delete, etc. methods.)<br></li><li> Write a recursive program that takes as input positive integers x and N, and returns x to the power N.<br>You should use O(log N) multiplications.<br></li><li> Dynamic Programming: Write a program that takes a positive integer N, and returns the number<br>of binary strings of length N such that there are no consecutive 1s. For example, if N = 3, the result<br>is 5, corresponding to the strings 000, 001, 010, 100, 101.<br></li><li> Greedy Algorithms and Invariants: Write a program that takes an input a positive integer<br>N, and returns the minimum number of coins in the US coinage system to create N cents. For example, if<br>N = 37, the answer is 4, corresponding to a quarter, a dime, and two pennies.<br></li><li> Graphs: Implement Depth First Search and Breadth First Search. (You will need to implement<br>classes suitable to representing graphs.)<br></li><li> Parallel Computing: Write a program which uses two threads to print the numbers from<br>1 to 100 in order. One thread can only print odd numbers, the other can only print even numbers.<br></li></ol>

You may be asked<br>questions related to general programming practices, which are conceptual and/or<br>knowledge-based, and do not require writing a program. (The extent to which<br>you are asked such questions depends on the company, your experience, the job, etc.)</p>
<p>Such questions tend to be narrow, and as such are not appropriate for our book.<br>We have begun the process of collecting representative questions, which you can see below. </p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="<!-￼0->"></h1><p><b>We wrote EPI for you!</b></p>
<p>EPI began as a Google Doc which we prepared for our friends who wanted to join companies<br>like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as hot startups.</p>
<p>Like you, they had talent, but were not familiar with the interviewing style<br>at these companies, and often failed to land their dream job.</p>
<p>For example, many of our friends had engineering and science degrees, or had been out of college for a while,<br>and were not prepared for data structures and algorithms interview questions.</p>
<p>EPI evens the playing field. Combined with your hard work, it will enable you<br>to interview successfully at the best companies.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="<!-￼0->"></h1><h2>Problem-driven approach</h2><br>EPI includes over 300 solved problems<br>representative of those asked at leading software companies.<br><p><br>With the exception of approximately 20 design problems, the<br>problems are designed to be codable in a 60 minute interview.<br></p><p><br>For many problems, at the end of its solution,<br>we describe a large number of variants.<br></p><p><br>We include a hints section, which consists of 1-2 sentence<br>suggestions, similar to what your interviewer will give you when you are stuck.<br></p><p><br><br><br></p><h2>The inside story</h2>

<p>All three of us successfully made it through the Google interview process, and went on to<br>work at Google, where, among other things, we interviewed candidates for our teams.</p>
<p></p><p><br>We have complementary backgrounds  (large company, startup, academia)<br>and have held multiple roles (individual contributor, tech lead, CTO, consultant, professor),<br>that gives us unparalleled insight into the job market.</p>
<p></p><p><br>In addition to Google, some of the other places we have worked at include<br>Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Qualcomm, and Synopsys, as well as a number of start-ups.<br>We have studied and taught at leading universities in the US (Berkeley, Texas) and<br>internationally (IIT Kanpur, National Tsing Hua University).</p>
<p>

</p><h2>Study guide</h2>

<p>We specify subsets of problems to solve and to review on based on the amount of time you<br>can commit, ranging from a weekend hackathon (intense!), to an hour a day for a semester.</p>
<p>

</p><h2>Commitment to excellence</h2><br>We have used best-in-class practices in the development of EPI: LaTeX for document<br>preparation, GitHub for revision control, agile development, continuous integration, unit testing.<br><p><br></p><p><br>As a concrete example, we have close to 200 figures in our book. These<br>were prepared using the TikZ extensions to LaTeX, which allow us to programmatically<br>specify figures, leading to much clearer illustrations.<br></p><p><br><br></p><h2>Tested programs</h2><br>EPI solutions are mostly written in C++. (The programs illustrating concurrency<br>are in Java.)<br><p><br><br>We have developed Java equivalents to the C++ programs. Both<br>C++ and Java versions for all problems, including test cases,<br>available from Google Code and GitHub. See code link in the sidebar for details.<br><br></p><h2>Nontechnical aspects of interviewing</h2>

<p>In a seperate chapter, we present a set of 14 data structure, algorithm, and design patterns -<br>useful general problem solving techniques that you can apply when you are stumped. We<br>have suggestions on when and where to apply them, as well as examples illustrating their use.</p>
<p>

</p><p>We describe how to prepare for an interview, how to conduct yourself<br>during the interview, and what to do afterwards. This review covers the<br>technical (selecting variable names, memory management)<br>as well as nontechnical (what to wear, what not to say).<br>We present insights into<br>the different company cultures, and how it impacts how you need to present yourself.</p>
<p>

</p><p>We give a brief account of interviewing from the interviewer’s  perspective.<br>In addition to being useful to anyone interviewing, this is useful for any<br>engineer conducting an interview.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="<!-￼0->"></h1><h3>The draft version of EPI in Java is ready!</h3>

<p>EPI is a community book - its content, quality, and very existence,<br>are a testament to the engagement and enthusiasm of its readers.</p>
<p>In this spirit, we are asking readers to help us by providing<br>feedback on 1-2 chapters on the Java draft.</p>
<p>By acting as a reviewer, you will get </p>
<ol><br><li>a chance to perfect your interviewing skills,<br></li><li> an early look at the book,<br></li><li> our undying gratitude, and,<br></li><li> a free hardcopy of the book, <em>if</em> you are one of the first 25 reviewers or make great contributions to this review.<br></li></ol>

<p><del>If you are interested, please sign up via this <!--<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/a9CsMJFXbn">-->Google form<!--</a>-->.</del></p>
<font color="red"><b>Due to enormous interest, we are no longer signing up reviewers. If you are very keen on participating,<br>please write directly to us - you can use adnan.aziz@gmail.com.</b></font>

<p>We expect reviewers to spend one to two afternoons going through<br>the chapter, and identify an issue every 1 to 2 pages. The text is very similar to that of<br>the current version - the big difference is in the programs which are now in Java. </p>
<p>The perfect is the enemy of the good - please send us your inputs as soon as you can. (We are hoping<br>to have a substantial amount of feedback by the end of August.)</p>
<p>Issues can be typos, language that is misleading, suboptimum solutions, bad programming practices - in short<br>anything that can improve the quality of the book.<br>Every individual issue you identify should be reported through a Google form, which you<br>can view <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/x0DJqUcP6e" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of issues reported by readers.<br>Note how specific these suggestions are - they have details on where the issue was, what the problem was, what the right wording should be, etc.</p>
<ol><br><li> Typo: 3rd paragraph, 3rd line: “<0, 7="" 0,="" 2,="" 3,="" 5,="">“. According to the input array, it should be “<0, 7="" 0,="" 2,="" 3,="" 6,="">“, because when we reach day 6, the max profit is 14 - 8 = 6, not 14 - 9 = 5.<br>This means on the last line of this paragraph, the last two elements in M should be 8 and 6 (instead of 7 and 5).<br><li> Comment: Why in problem 6.19 and the variant, we need to assume that n = 2^k? This condition is not really used in current solutions (unless you meant to discuss an alternate solution that uses divide and conquer to rotate the matrix by quarters).<br></li><li> Clarification: Solution 12.14: I feel the parameters in recursive function are confusing. Would it not be better to use two integers to keep track of the number of left parens we need and the number of right parens we need? If the first one is larger than 0, then we can add either left or right paren; otherwise we just add right parens. When both are 0, we save the valid prefix.<br></li><li> Error: Program in Solution 8.4 goes into an infinite loop<br>if there are duplicates entries in the input list. The problem statement should either explicitly<br>rule that out, or you should use a container which supports duplicate entries.<br></li><li> Suggestion: Drop Variant 10.16.1, as it is effectively the same as Problem 10.18.<br></li></0,></0,></li></ol>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="<!-￼0->"></h1><p><b>The Java version of EPI is <strike>in press</strike> ready!</b></p>
<p><img src="/epi-java-thumbnail.png"></p>
<p>With tag:</p>
<p><img src="epi-java-thumbnail.png" alt=""></p>
<strike>It should be available from Amazon in a few days.<br>We will post a direct link to the Amazon page when it is ready.</strike>

<p><b>It’s here!</b></p><p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517435803/" target="_blank" rel="external">Link</a> to Amazon page<br>for EPI in Java.</p>
<p></p><p><br><img src="/epi-java-amzn.png" width="600"></p>
<p>

</p><p>The only difference between the original EPI and EPI in Java is that<br>the programs are now in Java instead of C++. (We also have a short chapter<br>on Java, which includes best coding practices for an interview and a small<br>number of language review questions; this replaces the similar chapter on C++<br>in the original EPI.)</p>
<p>All programs, Java and C++, are always available from the website.</p>
<p>We will continue to sell the original EPI for readers who prefer C++.</p>
