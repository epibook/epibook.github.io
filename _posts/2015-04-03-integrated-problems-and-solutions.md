================

A number of readers have suggested integrating solutions with problems, that is presenting
the solution immediately after the problem. Their goal is to avoid having to go back
and forth.

This has been particularly challenging for readers using the Ebook - Google Play strips
the links we provide in the PDF between problems and solutions (and also to page and figure references).

We have updated EPI to have this integration. The new version is now available from Amazon.

If you have an Ebook, you can always get the latest version for free from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Adnan_Aziz_Elements_of_Programming_Interviews?id=y6FLBQAAQBAJ">Google Play</a>. 

Happy Reading,
The EPI Team
