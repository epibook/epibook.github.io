The EPI PDF sample
provides examples of EPI's organization, content,
style, topics, and quality.
<p>
<p>
Compare it with any competing
book (many of which have a preview available at Amazon), and
we're confident you'll choose EPI. (If you find any shortcomings, please drop us a line, we're always
looking for ways to improve.)
